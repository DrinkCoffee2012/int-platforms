P4 INT implementation for bmv2 switches running within mininet environment.
===========================================================================

This is P4 implementation of the In-band Network Telemetry. The P4 INT is deployed using testbed composed of three bmv2 switches running within Mininet virtual enviroment.
The whole environment is provided basing on p4app solution (https://github.com/p4lang/p4app).

The INT implementation and testing was done within the Gï¿½ANT Data Plane Programmibilty activity:
* website will be published soon

P4 INT
------

This project contains a few flavors of INT implementation:
- int_versions/int_v0.4.p4app - currently most tested version of INT; it is compatible with INT implementation contained in the ONOS network operating system
- int_versions/int_v1.5.p4app - initial implementation of INT v1.5 done accordingly very initial v2.0 specification  (develepment paused, not well tested)

Future plans assumes an implementation of v1.0 and latest version 2.x of the INT specification.

Additionally this repo contains also:
- int_versions/twamp_reflector.p4app - TWAMP reflector implementation in P4 (not related to INT).

All INT code use Apache 2.0 licence.

p4app
-----

p4app is a tool that can build, run, debug, and test P4 programs. The
philosophy behind p4app is "easy things should be easy" - p4app is designed to
make small, simple P4 programs easy to write and easy to share with others.

Installation
------------

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) if you don't
   already have it.

2. If you want, put the `p4app` script somewhere in your path. For example:

    ```
    cp p4app /usr/local/bin
    ```
I have already modified the default docker image to **dingdamu/p4app-ddos**, so `p4app` script can be used directly.

Usage
-----

p4app runs p4app packages. p4app packages are just directories with a `.p4app`
extension - for example, if you wrote a router in P4, you might place it in
`router.p4app`. Inside the directory, you'd place your P4 program, any
supporting files, and a `p4app.json` file that tells p4app how to run it.

Here's how you can run it:

```
p4app run examples/int_onos.p4app
```

If you run this command, you'll find yourself at a Mininet command prompt. p4app
will automatically download a Docker image containing the P4 compiler and tools,
compile P4 code, and set up a container with a simulated network you
can use to experiment. In addition to Mininet itself, you can use `tshark`,
`scapy`, and the net-tools and nmap suites right out of the box.

That's pretty much it! There's one more useful command, though. p4app caches the
P4 compiler and tools locally, so you don't have to redownload them every time,
but from time to time you may want to update to the latest versions. When that
time comes, run:

```
p4app update
```

Creating a p4app package
------------------------

Our p4app package has a directory structure that looks like this:

```
  hh.p4app
    |
    |- p4app.json
    |
    |- p4src/countmin.p4
    |
    |- read_registers1.sh
    |
    |- read_registers2.sh
    |
    |- read_registers3.sh
    |
    |- debug_switch1.sh
    |
    |- debug_switch2.sh
    |
    |- debug_switch3.sh
    |
    |- xterm_h1.sh
    |
    |- xterm_h2.sh
    |
    |- xterm_h3.sh





```

The `p4app.json` file is a package manifest that tells p4app how to build and
run a P4 program; it's comparable to a Makefile. Here's how our p4app looks:

```
{
  "program": "p4src/countmin.p4",
  "language": "p4-14",
  "targets": {
      "custom": {
	       "program": "topo.py"
      }
  }
}
```
It is possible to define the topology, P4-switch and host properties in `topo.py`

Testbed and implementation details
----------------------------------
Our emulation environment is composed by three switches emulated with Mininet. The adopted triangular topology is shown below. Each switch connects to a host, and the flows in the network are identified by {srcIP, dstIP} pairs.

The debug mode for each switch can be enabled by using:

``` 
    ./debug_switch1.sh
    ./debug_switch2.sh
    ./debug_switch3.sh
```    

The  terminal for each host are available by using:

``` 
    ./xterm_h1.sh
    ./xterm_h2.sh
    ./xterm_h3.sh
```    

The resulted logs and pcap files are in `/tmp/p4app_logs`
