2. Define trigger for int_sink [DONE]
3. Add control plane program for int_sink and int_report [DONE]

    - To Fix the computation of hdr.udp.len (the unique problem of sink, to discuss with Damian) [DONE]
    - Move remove_int and instance_type to int_metadata header [DONE]
5. Check compatibility with SDE 9.5.0
