1. Fix int_report
    - Fix truncate
    - some metadata in report_fixed_header cannot be enabled in Tofino
    - Optimize the computations in int header, e.g., remove left shift and find an alternative way
2. Define trigger for int_sink [DONE]
3. Add control plane program for int_sink and int_report [DONE]
4. Fix int_sink (it seems that the code breaks the constraints of Tofino)
    - To Fix the computation of hdr.udp.len (the unique problem of sink, to discuss with Damian)
    - Move remove_int and instance_type to bridge header
