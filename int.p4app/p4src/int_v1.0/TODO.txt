1. Fix int_report
    - Fix truncate (I need to fully understand what "truncate" does)
    - some metadata in report_fixed_header cannot be enabled in Tofino[DONE]
    - Optimize the computations in int header, e.g., remove left shift and find an alternative way (To discuss with Damian)
2. Define trigger for int_sink [DONE]
3. Add control plane program for int_sink and int_report [DONE]
4. Fix int_sink (it seems that the code breaks the constraints of Tofino)
    - To Fix the computation of hdr.udp.len (the unique problem of sink, to discuss with Damian)
        x Possible solution: use match action table, define the compuations in the match-action table
    - Move remove_int and instance_type to int_metadata header [DONE]
